# game-dev
A monorepo for small game dev projects.

Game development is an excellent way to learn programming and how I first started. I want to use game development as a means to grow my programming capabilities, solve interesting problems, and widen my skillset.

## Goals
1. Networking is something I've never fully explored, so I'm hoping to build multiplayer capabilities into some of these games to cement the fundamentals.
2. I've been wanting to build something with graphics, preferably from first-principles where possible. I've done a bit with frameworks like Lua's LOVE2D and Julia's GameZero.jl, but never SDL or Raylib.
3. I've heard of devs building small parsers for their text-based games, that could be cool to implement and learn more about.
4. AI/ML-wise, I haven't really looked at reinforcement learning and did some min-max tic-tac-toe stuff a while back, so it will be interesting to see different ways to write AIs.
5. As a means to make games web-based, WASM would be cool to compile to and explore more.

## Usage
Enter the sub-directories for more info and specific instructions.

## Languages
Currently, whichever I am learning at the time! It will likely be a combination of Julia, Lua, D, and Zig (see Zig-Zag-Zoe for my first real "project" using the language).

## License
Everything here is MIT licensed. In the future, specific artwork and such for graphical games may have specific CC-based licenses.
